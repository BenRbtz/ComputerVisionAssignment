# ComputerVisionAssignment

Computer Vision assignment in my 3rd year of University. 
The assignment was written in C++ using CMake to compile.
The purpose of the assignment was to implement filters that manipulate images.

The filters I implemented are:
- Median
- Gaussian
- Mean
- Laplacian
- Sobel Edge Detection
- Prewitt Edge Detection
- Sharpening
